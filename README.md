# The Simpsons Clicky Game

Simpsons Themed Image memory game

Players must click each of the 12 character only once in order to win

If they click a character's image multiple times in a round they lose

Every time an image is clicked, the images rendered to the page shuffle themselves in a random order

Once the user's score is reset after an incorrect guess, the game restarts
